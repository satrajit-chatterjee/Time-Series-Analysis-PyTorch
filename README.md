# Time-Series-Analysis
Simple implementation of multi-variate time series analysis using LSTMs

## File Description

1) generate_data.py generates time series data which can be used for testing purposes

2) test_lstm.py is a basic model using one LSTM layer for that can be used as a test-bed for your time series analysis model

3) time_series_lstm.py is the final model I built to be deployed for restaurant order prediction
